Extending Classes
-----------------
Example:
--------
Base or Parent class
--------------------
class Super 
{
    public:
      Super(); 
      void someMethod();
    protected: 
      int mProtectedInt;
    private:
      int mPrivateInt;
};

To build a new class called 'Sub' which inherit from 'Super' we use below syntax:

Inherited class
---------------
class Sub : public Super
{
    public
      Sub();
      void someOtherMethod();
}

Observations
-------------
OB1:    Code that uses the derived class does not need to know which class in your inheritance chain has defined a method in 
        order to call it. 
        Example:
        --------
        Sub mySub;
        mySub.someMethod();         <- someMethod is part of Base class i.e class Super
        mySub.someOtherMethod();
     
OB2:    Inheritance works in only one direction. Base class does not know anything about derived class.
        Example:
        --------
        Super mySuper;
        mySuper.someOtherMethod();   // Error! Super does not have a someOtherMethod().
     
OB3:    Sub class can agument the Super class by adding an additional method or data.
        Example:
        --------
        
        In above Sub derived class: void someOtherMethod() is new method added to derived class which is not in base class.
