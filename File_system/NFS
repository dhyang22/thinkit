NFS Filesystem Model
--------------------
Filesystem and Filesystem objects
---------------------------------
NFS File attribute - fsid: Uniquely identifies file system on the server.
                     fileid: identifies file or directories within that file system.
so fsid/fileid pair are unique for each file on a particular server.

Filesystem objects:             NFS calls
-------------------             ---------  
Files                     
Directories                     READDIR, READDIRPLUS to read list of file names from directories.
Symbolic links
Special files

Hard link - allows single file to have multiple names
Soft link - contains a path that references another file or directory.

NFS filehandle - a) it is reference to file or directory that is independent of the file name. All NFS operations use filehandle to identify 
                 the file or directory to which the operation applies.
                 b) Filehandle is opeque to the client.
                 c) Server creates the file handles and only server can interpret the data contained in the file handle.
                 d) NFS v2 - 32 bytes long and NFSv3 - 64 byte variable length.
                 
NFS LOOKUP operation evaluates only one path component at a time, why?
Reasons:
a) Pathname syntax - different OS have different syntax.
b) Client namespace - filesystem mountpointon the client can be detected and crossed.
c) Caching and latency - Most UNIX clients use a directory name lookup cache ( DNLC ) to cache previous pathname evaluations.

Stateless Server
a) Server Recovery
b) Idempotent operations
c) Statelessness and High Availaility
