# Excercise 2
# ------------
# In a script, an expression all by itself is a legal statement, but it doesnâ€™t do anything. The script
# 17 
# 3.2 
# "Hello, World!" 
# 1 + 1
# produces no output at all. How would you change the script to display the values of these four expressions?

17 
3.2 
"Hello, World!" 
1 + 1
